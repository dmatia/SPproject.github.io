let song01 = "I hate the winter
Can't stand the cold
I tend to cancel all the plans
(So sorry, I can't make it)
But when the heat comes
Something takes a hold
Can I kick it?
Yeah, I can

My cheeks in high color, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Forget all of the tears
That you've cried
It's over (Over)
(Over, over, over)
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming, my baby?

Acid green
Aquamarine
The girls are dancing
In the sand
And I throw my cellular device
In the water
Can you reach me?
No, you can't (Aha)

My cheeks in high color, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
(He's taking pictures)
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Turn it on
In a new kind of bright
It's solar (Solar)
(Solar, solar, solar)
Come on and let the bliss begin
Blink three times when you feel it kickin' in

That solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power";
